## Summary
This coding challenge required us to create a program that allows employees of a business (particularly customer support employees) to view their customer enquiries and needs via Zendesk tickets. This meant that the program had to communicate with the Zendesk api in order to display
bulk and specific ticket details.

## Architectural Design
I created a backend REST API that communicates directly with the Zendesk API. From here, I created a web client application using Angular 4 that directly communicates with my REST api. The main advantage of this design is that in future, we can incorporate many different client applications in different environments (eg. GUI applications). The REST API supports JSON data interchange format which is very ideal as this format is well documented, human readable and very popular amongst millions of developers.

### Stack and Tools used
*Backend:*
- [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - used to create the web application.
- [django REST](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) - used to actually build a REST API so clients can communicate with the service. This works on top of django.
- [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) - used to directly communicate with the Zendesk API.

*Frontend:*
- [Angular 4](https://angular.io/) - used to communicate with my REST api and also manage the client's frontend.
- [CoreUI-Free-Bootstrap-Admin-Template](https://github.com/mrholek/CoreUI-Free-Bootstrap-Admin-Template) - used for frontend design template.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - used for frontend design.
- [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) - used for frontend design.
- [Fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io/) - used for frontend design.
