    Zendesk data can return sideloaded resources in the form of arrays next to the actual requested resource. For
    instance, requesting a list of tickets (in an array) can also include the related users in another separate array.
    As such, the requested resource will have keys that have id values mapping to objects in the sideloaded data arrays.
    We must lookup these ids in the sideloaded resource arrays to get the relevant sideloaded object. This function aims
    to retrieve these sideloaded data and then use this data to create their associated objects with defined classes
    in z_api package.

    Eg. Requesting tickets with related users sideloaded.
